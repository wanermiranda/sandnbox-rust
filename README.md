# sadnbox-rust

As the name says it is a Sand N Box of testing rust things. 


## Intro 

This repo is made for experimentation on how to use rust on a daily basis for machine learning. While also learning a bit more about the language and its ways.

## What it does?
1. Call ML models using ONNX.
2. Use some known old NLP models like Bert and Roberta.
3. Tested some vectorial operations for Cosine Sim and Crossing between onnx, rust and model weights.
